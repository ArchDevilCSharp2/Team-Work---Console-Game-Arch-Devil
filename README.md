Description of the game:

Five-card draw is a poker variant that is considered the simplest variant of poker.
You play single-player.  Start with 100 coins and you can bet from 1 to 10 coins.
Then draw 5 cards. You can hold any card. The rest cards draw again (with new cards).

Your goal is to have one of the following combinations:
-	HIGH PAIR: two cards of the same rank higher than 10.
Example: J¦ J¦
-	TWO PAIR: two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank, not necessary to be high
Example: K¦ K¦ 9¦ 9¦
-	3 OF A KIND:  three cards of the same rank
Example: 2¦ 2¦ 2¦
-	STRAIGHT: five cards of sequential rank in at least two different suits
Example: Q¦ J¦ 10¦ 9¦ 8¦
-	FLUSH:  five cards are of the same suit, but not in sequence
Example: Q¦ 10¦ 7¦ 6¦ 4¦
-	FULL HOUSE:  three matching cards of one rank and two matching cards of another rank
Example: 3¦ 3¦ 3¦ 6¦ 6¦
-	4 OF A KIND: all four cards of one rank
Example: 9¦ 9¦ 9¦ 9¦
-	STRAIGHT FLUSH: five cards in sequence, all of the same suit
Example: Q¦ J¦ 10¦ 9¦ 8¦
-	ROYAL FLUSH: five cards in sequence, starting from 10 to A, all of the same suit
Example: 10¦ J¦ Q¦ K¦ A¦

In different hands you win different coins: for example if your bet is 10 (the maximum) and you have two pair you win 10 x2 = 20 coins.

The game ends when you played all your coins.
